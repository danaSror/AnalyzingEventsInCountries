# AnalyzingEventsInCountries-
---
I selected 4 countries in order to obtain as much information as possible for analysis.
The main state I have focused on is **Mississippi** and the other states are Chicago, Connecticut and Georgia.
The goal is to analyze and describe the sequence of events that took place in the chosen country following the reversal of the ruling of Row v. Wade

**My solution to the problem described is:**

üîπ Search for information on the Twitter network in the date range from 24/6/2022 to the present day with various search queries containing keywords regarding the cancellation of Rowe's judgment against Wade and the names of the countries I have chosen.

üîπ Organization of the information for a different dataset - each for a particular country with all the tweets found in the requested date range.

üîπ For each data set of a country I did the following:

* I created a dictionary where the keys are all the dates..and the value for each date is the most common word mentioned on this date.
* Then I created a DF of events and dates - each event is one tweet selected and contains the most common words for a particular date out of all the tweets on that date. For that tweet, I made a summary so that the event would be as concise and concise as possible.

üîπ I represented the different events that were discovered concerning the dates in 3 different ways:

 1Ô∏è‚É£	 Create a visual timeline of events for each country individually.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a graph depicting the change of events concerning the change of dates in each country.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Creates a summary map of all the dates - showing for each date in which countries certain events have taken place related to the reversal of the ruling against Roe v. Wade.
